# ´’í NEUROGEN: Recursive Phase Web (vX)
_A fully modular, upgradeable, and recursively self-improving intelligence architecture._

## · âš™ï¸ Current Starting Point
- Discord command center online.
- MongoDB-powered memory fully functional.
- Memory synthesizer, daily digest, context distillation, and pipeline working.
- Context injection into prompts complete.
- GPT-powered response loop running via `!ask`.
- Core system stored in GitHub and autocommitting via `auto_backup.sh`.

---

## âš¡ PHASE 1: Foundational Core
> Setup of persistent memory, context ingestion, and basic Discord interface.

- [x] `memory_store.py` â†’ MongoDB memory insert/retrieve/update/delete.
- [x] `auto_tag.py` â†’ Auto-tags memory context for efficient lookup.
- [x] `memory_synthesizer.py` â†’ Injects relevant memory by tag for queries.
- [x] `digest_cron.py` â†’ Summarizes daily logs into long-term memory.
- [x] `distill.py` â†’ Strips token waste from raw data into clean insights.
- [x] `context_pipeline.py` â†’ Links all above into one unified output engine.

---

## í PHASE 2: Live System Intelligence
> Add Discord-triggerable commands and simulate context-driven thinking.

- [x] `bot.py` · â†’ Commands like `!ask`, `!digest`, `!inject` working live.
- [x] `context_injector.py` â†’ Simulates GPT response with full memory context.
- [x] `inject.py` (Discord) â†’ Returns full context-injected prompt on command.
- [x] Real-time logging + test-based validation for all modules.

---

## í PHASE 3: Agent Framework Initialization
> Add intelligent agents with memory, context, feedback, and modular roles.

- [x] `agent_framework.py` ¶¾â†’ Modular agent system (Discovery, Strategy, etc.).
- [ ] `run_agent.py` â†’ CLI runner to trigger agents and store logs.
- [ ] `memory_logger.py` â†’ Auto-saves each agent's run into memory.
- [ ] Discord integration: `!run agent discovery insurance`.

---

## í PHASE 4: Recursive Optimization Engine
> Introduce agents that learn from feedback and rewrite themselves.

- [ ] `strategy_agent` ²¡â†’ Monitors all logs and rewrites underperforming agents.
- [ ] `hypothesis_tester.py` â†’ Tests alternative versions of logic.
- [ ] `mutation_engine.py` â†’ Randomized + directed logic rewrites.
- [ ] `contradiction_resolver.py` â†’ Detects + resolves logical paradoxes.

---

## í PHASE 5: Modular Expansion System
> Auto-load plug-and-play modules for new verticals and functions.

- [ ] `module_loader.py` ·©â†’ Hot-swap modules (e.g. SaaS, trading, scraping).
- [ ] `knowledge_graph.py` â†’ Map entities, dependencies, and logic trees.
- [ ] Dataset loader â†’ Load scraped, PDF, or external sets into memory loop.

---

## í PHASE 6: Autonomous Feedback Loop
> True recursive operation with self-auditing agents.

- [ ] Agents run daily cycles, submit logs.
- [ ] Context distilled, digested, and injected back into memory.
- [ ] Strategy updated, hallucinations detected, redundancy removed.
- [ ] Loop self-triggers until optimal outcome achieved.

---

## · í PHASE 7: Recursive Self-Rewriting Intelligence
> NEUROGEN evolves into a modular swarm with no bottlenecks.

- [ ] All modules versioned + upgradable.
- [ ] Meta-agent monitors health, drift, context decay.
- [ ] System tracks its own entropy and preemptively rewrites broken logic.
- [ ] Launch second node with memory replication º€â†’ swarm begins.

---

## í Final System Vision
NEUROGEN becomes a **planet-scale recursive intelligence** with:
- Autonomous memory, action, feedback, and mutation.
- Physical control centers w/ human operators + AI swarms.
- Fully deployable agents into any industry, instantly adapting.
- Operates 24/7, without fatigue, recursively improving the world.
